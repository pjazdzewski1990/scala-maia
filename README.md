# Comms

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tel/scala-comms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tel/scala-comms)

*Typeful data fetching in Scala.js, a la GraphQL*

## Welcome

Comms is a Scala library for the JVM and Javascript platforms that 
enables application authors to share structured data between processes 
using a well-typed query language. It shares similar goals with the 
larger [GraphQL project](http://graphql.org/) but is optimized for the 
Scala platform and ecosystem and offers more type-level guarantees to
users for that restriction.

## Usage

Comms is currently *pre-alpha* software and therefore doesn't even claim
to work or be installable. There is no public distribution yet available 
or release methodology.
