*Highly-typeful data fetching in Scala.js, a la GraphQL*

## Welcome

Maia is a Scala library for the JVM and Javascript platforms that
enables application authors to share structured data between processes 
using a well-typed query language. It shares similar goals with the 
larger [GraphQL project](http://graphql.org/) but is optimized for the 
Scala platform and ecosystem and offers more type-level guarantees to
users for that restriction.

## Etymology

Maia is Greek for "midwife", but more directly it refers to the maieutic,
or socratic, method---a didactic method of having a discussion through a
series of questions and answers.
