# Title

ADR-000: Write ADRs

# Summary

"Architectural decisions", decisions relating the to design and 
framework for the library will be described and documented using an a
series of ADRs so as to create a history and a tradition for the 
library.

# Context

It's often difficult to understand the history of a library. Design 
documents capture the now but leave out context and evolution. New 
contributors can face difficulty understanding the library. Existing 
contributors can encounter confusion as history fades from immediate 
memory.
  
# Decision

Major architectural decisions relating to the design of the library or 
the community will be documented in an ADR format similar to the one 
used here.

# Consequences

- Patches may be blocked temporarily until a relevant ADR is in place.
- As problems are identified the decision on how to solve them may be 
  drafted before an actual patch is in place. If the decision is carried 
  out then we can *ratify* the ADR.
- Problems which point out holes in the fabric of decision-making should
  be considered real problems with real impact and solved.
