For instance, a commercial project which uses this code as a library in
building a distributed application may only need to remark somewhere publicly
that this code is being used and is freely available.

This license was chosen so as to clearly protect the rights for this software
to be widely used in commercial projects while restricting the rights of
others to use this code and directly compete with this project without
contributing back.
